# Git and Github


![Alt text](../images/flow.jpg)


## Terminology
### Basic Terminology
* `repo` - the git repository locally and on the remote (i.e. github)
* `clone` - copy a remote repository from github
* `add` - `stage` files ready to make a commit
* `commit` - add the staged changes to the git repository
* `push` - push all changes to the remote repository (i.e. github)
* `pull` - get any changes from the remote repository

### Advanced stuff
* `branch` - create a new branch for development, bugfixes, etc
* `merge` - bring two branches back together

And in the following, means you've got out of sync between the local and remote;
Don't try and use these, they'll just confuse!
* `stash` - save the out of sync changes away
* `pop` - merge back in out of sync changes of synchronised    

## Git
* Is a local version control system (VCS), common in software development
* Can be used (usefully) on any text based files
* Not intended for large file storage. **i.e. Not recommended for datasets!**
We will cover the `.gitignore` file for this.
* Designed to be used with remote repositories
(i.e. on Github, Bitbucket, Gitlab etc)


## Github
* Is a remote storage for git repositories, focussed on collaborative development
* Contains many features and tools for development on large scales
* For our purpose is useful as a backup of our code, and also a public
advertisement of our skills
