## Notes on markdown
Markdown is useful to assist with documenting your project. Any github repository 
should ideally have a README.md file (such as this one) in the root of the project.

This should be done at least to a minimal level. See the following resources;

Markdown is also exceptionally useful for referencing code either `incline` where
you may reference package or function names, but youcan also create code blocks as below;

```python
import time

while True:
  time.sleep(60)
  print("Another minute has passed!)
 ```
